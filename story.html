           The dream started back in 1998. Pat was working on a commercial fishing vessel in Alaska, and really wanted to dip something delicious in her morning coffee. The only thing she had around was salmon! After a little trial and error, Pat started using salmon scraps from around the boat (always be recycling) to make the first salmon cookie. When she reached moorage in Anchorage, she kept up her baking in the summer months, adding a delicious layer of frosting and perfecting the process. When she showed up the next season, all of her fellow fishers wanted more! Thats when she knew she had to move home and start a business (and apparently a family!)

        <h2>The Modern Salmon Cookie</h2>
        <p>
          After a lot of work, we finally got the cookie looking good! We use only the best salmon scraps, and grind them up to a super fine grain. Next we mix in our special spice mix and flour to make our delicious salmon slurry! Bake with love for 5 hours to get the delicious snack of the century.
